# Medical Diagnosis System Using Case-Based Reasoning

## Overview

This project involves developing a functional prototype of a medical diagnosis system based on Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). The system aims to identify possible diseases based on symptoms reported by patients. The provided symptoms are compared with previous cases to identify potential diseases and recommend treatments. The application is implemented using the MyCBR tool.

## Features

- **Symptom Input**: Users can input symptoms they are experiencing.
- **Case Comparison**: The system compares the input symptoms with previous cases stored in the database.
- **Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendation**: Based on the comparison, the system identifies possible diseases and suggests treatments.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-diagnosis-cbr.git
    cd medical-diagnosis-cbr
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up MyCBR**:
    - Download and install MyCBR from MyCBR official site.
    - Follow the instructions to set up MyCBR and integrate it with the project.

## Usage

1. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Input Symptoms**:
    - Enter the symptoms you are experiencing into the system.

3. **Get Diagnosis**:
    - The system will compare your symptoms with previous cases and provide a possible diagnosis along with recommended treatments.
